Magic The Gathering Rules Website

Developed using Node C++ addons, Fastify, React and Redux. Did not use SQL since I wanted to explore how I can parse the file directly with C++.

It was my first time using Fastify, Redux, OOP C++, and making Node C++ addons.
It was a second time using React.

It took about a full time week to develop.
